# Foodie-Fi Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Foodie-Fi Data Analysis project! This project focuses on analyzing subscription data from Foodie-Fi, a streaming service dedicated exclusively to cooking shows and culinary content. Using SQL queries, I explore various aspects of the subscription data to gain insights into customer behavior, subscription trends, and overall business performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of two main tables:

1. **Subscriptions**: Contains information about customer subscriptions, including customer ID, plan ID, and start date.
2. **Plans**: Contains details about different subscription plans, such as plan ID, plan name, and price.

## SQL Concepts Applied
Throughout the project, I apply various SQL concepts to analyze the dataset, including:

- **Data Retrieval**: SELECT statements to retrieve data from the database tables.
- **Data Filtering**: WHERE clause to filter data based on specific criteria, such as date ranges or plan types.
- **Data Aggregation**: COUNT, AVG, and other aggregate functions to calculate metrics such as customer count, average price, and retention rates.
- **Data Manipulation**: JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables and derive insights from related datasets.
- **Conditional Logic**: CASE statements to categorize data into different groups based on specified conditions.
- **Subqueries**: Nested queries to perform advanced data analysis and calculate derived metrics.

## Lessons Learned
Through this project, I learned valuable lessons about analyzing subscription data and deriving insights using SQL. Some key takeaways include:

- Understanding customer behavior and subscription patterns is crucial for optimizing business strategies and improving customer retention.
- Data-driven decision-making empowers businesses to make informed choices and drive growth based on actionable insights.
- SQL proficiency is essential for performing advanced data analysis tasks and extracting valuable insights from complex datasets.

## Possible Outcomes
Based on the SQL queries written above, some possible outcomes include:

- Understanding the distribution of subscription plans and pricing options among customers.
- Analyzing the customer journey from trial subscriptions to paid plans and identifying opportunities for optimizing onboarding processes.
- Calculating key metrics such as churn rate, retention rate, and average revenue per user (ARPU) to evaluate business performance and customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion
The Foodie-Fi Data Analysis project provides valuable insights into customer behavior and subscription trends within the streaming service industry. By applying SQL concepts to analyze subscription data, I gain actionable insights that can inform business strategies, improve customer retention, and drive growth for Foodie-Fi.
